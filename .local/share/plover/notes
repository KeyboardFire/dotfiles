*F = trailing -h (eh, uh, heh, huh, hah, yeah, oh, meh, bah, gah, etc.)

when a stroke is defined as an abbreviation or shortened phrase, both adding *
(when possible) and stroking it twice should produce the expanded version
e.g.
H-G         = Hitchhiker's Guide
H*G         = The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
H-G/H-G     = The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

punctuation:
N-SH        = –
M-SH        = —
-FPGS       = \
-RBLT       = /                 (mnemonic: look at the shape on the keyboard)
U-U         = .
L-L         = ,
U-L         = !
L-U         = ?
UL-UL       = ‽
here U denotes the top two keys on 3rd and 4th finger, L denotes the bottom two
add * to invert (¿¡⸘)

modifiers:
LUR         = lower
KPA         = Upper
KPLA        = CAPITALIZED
D-LS        = deletespace
S-P         = force space
all modifiers take * to remove space (except S-P), -D to apply to previous word

modes:
L-MD        = lower
T(L)-MD     = Title
K-MD        = CAPITALIZED
D-MD        = deletespace
S(N)-MD     = snake_case
KL-MD       = camelCase
H-MD        = hyphenated-mode
R-MD        = (reset)

other meta:
T*T         = toggle *
R*PT        = repeat last stroke

memes:
SH-RG       = ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
(S)DPR-VL   = ಠ_ಠ
TBL-FPL     = (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

not-necessarily-intuitive briefs:
-J          = ninja'd
AOM         = almo              (M contains L)
M-F         = mfw
TPW         = tfw
TPW*        = ftw
TW-F        = wtf
. + H       = .-.               (mnemonic: H = hyphen)
